    <h2>Exploring The World</h2>
    <p>The ocean is vast and expansive and we have only explored 30% of it even though it is 70% of our own world. Most people expect me to blame Nasa and others who vaoyage space but nasa actually gave funding to the space exploration program to further the reasearch of our beautiful world.Much is known about human impact on land wilderness, but until recently, less has been known about how human activity and climate change have affected marine vitality. In a study published Thursday in Current Biology, researchers have determined that marine wilderness accounts for only 13 percent—some 34 million square kilometers—of the ocean. Marine wilderness is area that has experienced low or no human disturbance. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the highest concentrations of marine wilderness are found far away from typical human reach: in the high seas and less-populated southern hemisphere. Coastal areas contain only 10 percent of marine wilderness. Only five percent of wilderness is in internationally protected areas. While that pattern is predictable, Kendall Jones, lead author and conservation planning specialist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, said he expected to find more wilderness. He attributes some of the result to a growing fishing industry continually pushing its own physical boundaries. “Fishing is the most significant way in which humans impact the ocean,” he said. Life, as we know it, is based on water. But because water makes up approximately 72 percent of the Earth's surface, water-like air-is often taken for granted. For many of us the ocean is merely a trip to the beach. However, scientists go all over the world to see and study the ocean and marine life. Debris from man-made items, especially those made of plastics are finding their way into the oceans. On the sands of Laysan, a remote Pacific Island has plastic trash washed ashore by the waters of the Pacific. Today, this is happening on remote islands around the world. Floating and beached plastic is an eyesore, however, the problem goes far beyond aesthetics. Scientific studies report that plastic trash is causing injury and death to countless marine animals that feast on it or become ensnared in it. Plastics may even be one of the greatest source of mortality among marine mammals as are oil spills, heavy metals or other toxic materials. Prime contributors to the growing tide of plastic pollution are the world's merchant ships, which, dump at least 16.6 million tons of trash overboard every year. Some 1639,000 plastic containers and bags are tossed into the oceans every day. Commercial fishermen are also major offenders. Estimates of the plastic fishing gear lost or discarded at sea every year range as high as 1150,000 tons. Boaters and beach-goers add to the marine litter with six-pack yokes, picnic utensils, sandwich bags and Styrofoam cups. Cities and industries discharging waste directly into the water or dumping it at sea are also to blame. Perhaps the most ubiquitous form of plastic trash is the tiny polyethylene pellets used in the manufacture of plastic items and are use in shipping. Almost without exception, many surveys show plastic accounts for over three-fourths of the man-made products on the ocean surface. This plastic is taking a heavy toll on marine life, particularly on seals, sea lions, turtles and seabirds. By one estimate, as many as over 90,000 northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands die each year after becoming enshrouded in netting. Young seals get their heads or flippers caught in it. Then they either become exhausted from toting it or their ability to catch food is restricted. Smaller plastic items are frequently mistaken for prey by turtles and birds, often with fatal results. Leatherback turtles, which feast on jellyfish, are particularly attracted to plastic bags. Any kind of film or semi-translucent material appears to look like jellyfish to them. At least 42 species of seabirds are known to snack on plastic. Of 50 albatrosses found ill or dead on the Midway Islands, 45 had eaten some form of the substance. In several, the plastic had either obstructed the digestive tract or caused ulcers. Everything from toy soldiers to pens, fishing bobbers and poker chips in the birds' stomachs."</p>
